         <h4>Making cake</h4>
         <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 350 degree F</p>
     <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl.<br>Set aside. beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl until creamed, about 2 minutes<br> Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat on high speed until combined </p>
     
     <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>With the mixer running on low speed, add the dry<br> ingredients and milk to the wet ingredients until combined. make sure to leave no lumps in the batter <br>and that the batter is a thick.</p>
     <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Bake for 30-36 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean<br> then let the cake to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack. </p>

     <p><strong>Step 5:</strong>With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium <br>speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners' sugar, heavy cream, and vanilla extract <br>with the mixer running on low. Increase to high speed and beat for 3 full minutes.</p>
     <p><strong>Step 6:</strong>Crumble the cooled cake into the bowl on top of the frosting. Make sure there are no large<br> lumps. Turn the mixer on low and beat the frosting and cake crumbles together until combined.</p>
     <p><strong>Step 7:</strong>Measure 1 Tablespoon of moist cake mixture and roll into a ball. Place balls on a lined<br>  baking  sheet. Refrigerate for 2 hours or freeze for 1 hour. Re-roll the chilled balls to smooth out<br> , if  needed.Place back into the fridge as you'll only work with a couple at a time.</p>
     
     <p><strong>Step 8:</strong>Melt the coating in a 2-cup liquid measuring cup (best for dunking!). <br>you can use a double boiler or microwave.</p>
     
     <p><strong>step 9:</strong>Coat the cake balls: Remove only 2-3 cake balls from the refrigerator at a time<br> Dip a lollipop stick about 1/2 inch into the coating, then insert into the center or the cake ball. <br>Only push it about halfway through the cake ball. Dip the cake ball into the coating until it is<br> completely covered. Make sure the coating covers the base of the cake ball where it meets the<br> lollipop stick. Very gently tap the stick against the edge of the measuring cup<br> to allow excess coating to drop off. Decorate the top with sprinkles and place upright into a <br>styrofoam block or box (as explained above). Repeat with remaining cake balls, only working <br>with some out of the refrigerator at a time.The cake balls must be very cold when dipping!</p>
      <p><strong>step 10:</strong>Coating will set within an hour. Store cake pops in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</p>
